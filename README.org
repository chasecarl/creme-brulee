* Crème brûlée
This is my minimal Emacs configuration.
* Installation
Clone this repo either to:
- [Emacs 28.x and lower] your ~/.emacs.d or ~/.config/emacs
- [Emacs 29+] in addition to the above, you can use any directory

  But you will have to launch Emacs with ~--init-directory /path/to/cloned/repo~.
* Usage
Launch Emacs, it will clone (and probably compile) all the packages
used by Crème brûlée.
